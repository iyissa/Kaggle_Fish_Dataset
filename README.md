# Kaggle_Fish_Dataset
Building machine learning models using different techniques 

I recently started Daniel Bourke's TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2022: Zero to Mastery and while learning, I will be practicing techniques that have been taught in the course and applying them to data that I find. 

This is a simple classification model built for a fish prediction dataset found at https://www.kaggle.com/akdagmelih/multiplelinear-regression-fish-weight-estimation/data

After the creation of a machine learning model, the most important thing do be done is the evaluation of a model. I wrote an article on evaluating machine learning models and you can read it here https://ayoyissa.hashnode.dev/evaluation-metrics-for-an-ml-regression-model
